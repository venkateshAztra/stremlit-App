LangChain is a framework to build LLM-powered apps.
It provides tools for document loading, splitting, embeddings, and vector search.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps LLMs access external knowledge.
You can combine local files, databases, or APIs with LLMs using LangChain.
OpenAI, HuggingFace, and Cohere are common embedding providers.
